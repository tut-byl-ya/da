# keys correspond not to Presence Fields, but to pypresence arguments!

#
# state (str) – the user’s current status
# details (str) – what the player is currently doing
# start (int) – epoch time for game start or None to hide Time Elapsed ## In this code can also be "start_time" (default) or "new_time"
# end (int) – epoch time for game end
# large_image (str) – name of the uploaded image for the large profile artwork
# large_text (str) – tooltip for the large image
# small_image (str) – name of the uploaded image for the small profile artwork
# small_text (str) – tootltip for the small image
# party_size (list) – current size of the player’s party, lobby, or group, and the max in this format: [1,4]
# buttons (list) – list of up to two dicts for buttons, in the format {"label": "My Website", "url": "https://qtqt.cf"}

# Name of the label that should update Presence to `start_state` when entered.
# Can also be a list label names, if you have multiple start labels.
